 * back button of the navigation controller interface).

    /// Under normal circumstances, user interactions do not directly cause ``ViewControllable`` instances to
    /// be dismissed, for example when simply tapping a button. To dismiss a ``ViewControllable`` instance in
    /// these situations, the `Context` instance will be informed of the button tap which then informs the `Flow`
    /// instance to initiate the dismissal. The `Flow` instance retrieves the appropriate child `Flow` instance
    /// (by type) and, only after the dismissal is complete, detaches the child `Flow` instance using the
    /// ``detach(ending:)`` method.
    ///
    /// However, in some cases, user interactions can directly cause ``ViewControllable`` instances to be dismissed,
    /// for example when interacting with ``UINavigationController`` (from `UIKit`). By long pressing the back button
    /// of a ``UINavigationController``, a user may navigate backward to any point in the navigation history, which
    /// directly causes one or more ``ViewControllable`` instances to be immediately popped off the navigation stack.
    /// In these situations, to detach `Flow` instances corresponding to already dismissed ``ViewControllable``
    /// instances, the `Context` instance will be informed of the dismissal (and be provided the ``ViewControllable``
    /// instances) which then informs the `Flow` instance to perform the detachment only.
    ///
    /// Example:
    /// ```
    /// func detach(endingFlowsFor viewControllers: [ViewControllable]) {
    ///     detach(endingSubFlowsOfType: ViewControllableFlow.self) { flow in
    ///         viewControllers.contains { $0 === flow.viewController }
    ///     }
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// In the above example, the `where` closure returns `true` if the ``ViewControllable`` of the `flow` exists in
    /// the given `viewControllers` array.
    ///
    /// - Important: Use the ``detach(endingSubFlowsOfType:where:)`` method only when ``ViewControllable``
    ///   instances are dismissed directly within the UI framework (before the `Context` instance is informed of the
    ///   interaction). And therefore, in normal situations, use the ``detach(ending:)`` method whenever the `Flow`
    ///   instance initiates the dismissal.
    ///
    /// For a `Flow` instance to be informed of any view controllers popped off of a navigation stack as a result of
    /// user interactions, the view controller must subclass ``NavigationController`` providing a closure in which to
    /// call the receiver method.
    ///
    /// Example:
    /// ```
    /// class ViewController: NavigationController {
    ///
    ///     init() {
    ///         super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)
    ///         onPopViewControllers { [weak self] in
    ///             self?.receiver?.didPopViewControllers($0)
    ///         }
    ///     }
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// The `Context` (receiver) instance is then responsible for forwarding the ``ViewControllable`` collection to the
    /// `Flow` instance.
    ///
    /// Example:
    /// ```
    /// func didPopViewControllers(_ viewControllers: [ViewControllable]) {
    ///     flow?.detach(endingFlowsFor: viewControllers)
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// - Parameter didPopViewControllers: A closure in which to call the receiver method.
