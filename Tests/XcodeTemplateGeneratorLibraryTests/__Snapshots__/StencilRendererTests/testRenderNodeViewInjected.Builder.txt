     Dependencies
     ============

     Declare dependencies as 'fileprivate' properties (increasing access control only as necessary).

     fileprivate let example: Example = .init()

     Whenever possible, for example when the dependency does not provide shared state, define the property as a
     factory that always returns a new instance. Factory properties are preferred over factory methods to ensure
     Needle compatibility whenever the access control is increased.

     fileprivate var exampleFactory: Example {
         Example()
     }

     When shared state is desired but the dependency depends on another dependency, use the `shared` helper method
     that always returns the same instance from a computed property.

     fileprivate var example: Example {
         shared { Example(otherDependency: dependency.otherDependency) }
     }
